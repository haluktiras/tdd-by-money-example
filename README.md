# Test Driven Development

Examples provided have been inspired by Kent Beck's examples in his book [Test-Driven Development By Example](https://amzn.to/2DTP58p)

In this repository, I look at using Beck's classic TDD Money Example - updated to Java 13 and JUnit 5. 

### Stack
* Java 13. Previous versions of Java are un-tested.
* Maven 3.5.2
* JUnit 5

### Test Coverage
* 100% class level test coverage
* 94% method level test coverage
* 96% line level test coverage
